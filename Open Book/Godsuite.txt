The statue of Marika was indeed a gateway to the beyond. Energy for realm jumps was no longer an issue. A slight agitation and the boy has found himself immersed in the radiant embrace of the Light realm. Blossoming with the holy grace and life, studying the various flora and fauna was what followed. Each organism, bathed in the celestial glow, revealed intricate details that seemed to dance with the cosmic energies.  Arrakis-dex, once so empty and lifeless, was teeming with symphony and life. He then went on to hone the power of the light element.
With enough energy capsules and resources in hand, he finally decides to dive into the realm which has been constantly giving off its ominous aura, the Dark realm. The dark forces of the chaos was nauseating. But the mask powered by holy energy protects all. Faced with multiple split realties, navigation was a task of its own right. Everything seemed to be corrupted and degrading. Void fluid.This enigmatic substance seemed to erase the very essence of the soul. A key to liberation from the perpetual cycle of rebirth. The journey through the Dark realm became a test of the boy's resilience, with the corrupted realities posing both existential threats and glimpses into the mysteries that lay at the intersection of chaos and enlightenment.
